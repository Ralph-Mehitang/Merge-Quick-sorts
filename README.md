Merge-Quick-sorts

(a)The best time complexity for quicksort is omega(nlogn) with the worst being O(n log n). Mergesort also being a recursive algorithm shares the same runtime.
the best for selection is omega(n^2) and the worst being O(n^2)
(b)The absolute timing scale with the number of elements all depends on how large the elements are, of course the more elements you pass to the array to sort the longer it will take to go.
(c)the best cases for both algorithms are when the values are under 5k upon hitting 5k their runtime
(d)My observations do confirm the best and worst cases. Mergesort seems to handle it much better sorting a 1 million random values took 2.1 seconds while in merge sort it took .37
(e) with their recursive nature these two algorithms are much more efficient and noticebly faster than bubblesort. 
(f)  From looking at my code, I can't see anywhere I would need to improve my code. I think everything is properly commented. i made the menu rather straightforward and I have no memory leaks
